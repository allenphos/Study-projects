# Study Projects
## Overview
This repository contains projects completed as part of my studies to develop data science and machine learning skills:

1. **Car Price Prediction:**  
   Built a multiple linear regression model to predict car prices based on attributes like mileage, engine size, and brand. The project involved data cleaning, visualization, and model evaluation.

2. **Credit Data Preprocessing:**  
   Preprocessed a dataset of credit applications to prepare it for analysis and modeling. Key steps included handling missing values, transforming features, and addressing outliers to enable reliable credit risk assessment.

Projects demonstrate practical applications of data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning techniques using Python.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
