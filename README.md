# Study Projects
## Overview
This repository contains projects completed as part of my studies at Noroff University and Data Loves Academy (https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-loves-academy/posts/?feedView=all) to develop data science and machine learning skills:

1. **Car Price Prediction:**  
   Built a multiple linear regression model to predict car prices based on attributes like mileage, engine size, and brand. The project involved data cleaning, visualization, and model evaluation.

2. **Credit Data Preprocessing:**  
   Preprocessed a dataset of credit applications to prepare it for analysis and modeling. Key steps included handling missing values, transforming features, and addressing outliers to enable reliable credit risk assessment.
   
3. **Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning:**  
   Applied logistic regression and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and SMOTE-Tomek techniques to segment customers for targeted marketing strategies in the automobile industry. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve optimal segmentation results.

4. **Overfitting and Regularization in Regression:**
   Compared Linear and Polynomial Regression models to demonstrate overfitting in regression. Utilized regularization techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to mitigate overfitting and enhance model generalization.

In **Bank Customer Churn Prediction** directory:

   1. **Logistic Regression with Scikit-Learn: Bank Customer Churn Prediction:**   
      Developed a logistic regression model to predict customer churn based on demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and          evaluation. Currently participating in a Kaggle competition and ranking on the leaderboard.

   3. **Polynomial Feature Engineering for Enhanced Churn Modeling:**   
      Developed a logistic regression model with polynomial features to predict customer churn. The project included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Conducted experiments with             different polynomial degrees to optimize model performance. Achieved an improved score in the Kaggle competition "Bank Customer Churn Prediction (DLU Course)".

   5. **Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Customer Churn Prediction:**   
      Developed a decision tree classifier to predict customer churn based on demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.        Applied techniques to address class imbalance, including class weighting and resampling. Experimented with different hyperparameters and tree depths to optimize performance. Currently participating in the Kaggle           competition and ranking on the leaderboard.
   

Projects demonstrate practical applications of data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning techniques using Python.
